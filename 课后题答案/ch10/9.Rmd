Scaling the variables effects the max height of the dendogram obtained from
hierarchical clustering. From a cursory glance, it doesn't effect the bushiness
of the tree obtained. However, it does affect the clusters obtained from cutting
the dendogram into 3 clusters. In my opinion, for this data set the data should 
be standardized because the data measured has different units ($UrbanPop$ 
compared to other three columns).
