### a
```{r}
data = read.csv("./Ch10Ex11.csv", header=F)
dim(data)
```

### b
```{r 2b}
dd = as.dist(1 - cor(data))
plot(hclust(dd, method="complete"))
plot(hclust(dd, method="single"))
plot(hclust(dd, method="average"))
```

Two or three groups depending on the linkage method.

### c
To look at which genes differ the most across the healthy patients and diseased
patients, we could look at the loading vectors outputted from
PCA to see which genes are used to describe the variance the most.
```{r}
pr.out = prcomp(t(data))
summary(pr.out)
total_load = apply(pr.out$rotation, 1, sum)
indices = order(abs(total_load), decreasing=T)
indices[1:10]
total_load[indices[1:10]]
```
This shows one representation of the top 1% of differing genes. 

(*) I'm not sure this is the correct way to aggregate the loading vector.
