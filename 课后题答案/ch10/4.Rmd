### a
Not enough information to tell. The maximal intercluster dissimilarity could be
equal or not equal to the minimial intercluster dissimilarity. If the
dissimilarities were equal, they would fuse at the same height. If they were
not equal, they single linkage dendogram would fuse at a lower height.

### b
They would fuse at the same height because linkage does not affect leaf-to-leaf
fusion.
