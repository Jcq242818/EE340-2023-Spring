Chapter 8: Exercise 5
=====================


```r
p = c(0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.2, 0.55, 0.6, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75)
```


## Majority approach

```r
sum(p >= 0.5) > sum(p < 0.5)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

The number of red predictions is greater than the number of green predictions
based on a 50% threshold, thus RED.

## Average approach

```r
mean(p)
```

```
## [1] 0.45
```

The average of the probabilities is less than the 50% threshold, thus GREEN.
