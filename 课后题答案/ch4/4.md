### a.
On average, 10%. For simplicity, ignoring cases when X < 0.05 and X > 0.95.

### b. 
On average, 1%

### c.
On average, $0.10^{100} * 100 = 10^{-98}$%.

### d.
As $p$ increases linear, observations that are geometrically near decrease 
exponentially.

### e.
$$
p = 1, l = 0.10
\\
p = 2, l = \sqrt{0.10} ~ 0.32
\\
p = 3, l = 0.10^{1/3} ~ 0.46
\\
...
\\
p = N, l = 0.10^{1/N}
$$
