Chapter 7: Exercise 5
=====================

## a
We'd expect $\hat{g_2}$ to have the smaller training RSS because it will be a 
higher order polynomial due to the order of the derivative penalty function.

## b
We'd expect $\hat{g_1}$ to have the smaller test RSS because $\hat{g_2}$ could
overfit with the extra degree of freedom.

## c
Trick question. $\hat{g_1} = \hat{g_2}$ when $\lambda = 0$.
