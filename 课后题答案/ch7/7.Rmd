Chapter 7: Exercise 7
=====================

```{r}
library(ISLR)
set.seed(1)
```

```{r 7.1,fig.width=16}
summary(Wage$maritl)
summary(Wage$jobclass)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(Wage$maritl, Wage$wage)
plot(Wage$jobclass, Wage$wage)
```
It appears a married couple makes more money on average than other groups. It
also appears that Informational jobs are higher-wage than Industrial jobs on
average.

## Polynomial and Step functions
```{r 7.2}
fit = lm(wage~maritl, data=Wage)
deviance(fit)
fit = lm(wage~jobclass, data=Wage)
deviance(fit)
fit = lm(wage~maritl+jobclass, data=Wage)
deviance(fit)
```

## Splines
Unable to fit splines on categorical variables.

## GAMs
```{r}
library(gam)
fit = gam(wage~maritl+jobclass+s(age,4), data=Wage)
deviance(fit)
```

Without more advanced techniques, we cannot fit splines to categorical 
variables (factors). `maritl` and `jobclass` do add statistically significant
improvements to the previously discussed models.
